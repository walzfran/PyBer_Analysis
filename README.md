# PyBer_Analysis
Module 5

### The purpose of this analysis is to go over data that has been collected on rides and drivers in 3 different city types; urban, suburban, and rural. I began by uploading the information and merging the data sets so it was a clearer visual and the information was then side by side. I then ran code to get detailed information the first was the amount of total rides for each city type I then found the total number of drivers and the total fares collected. This data was used to then calculate the average fare per ride, the average fare and the average fare per driver. This information was then used to create a graph that easily shows the total fares collected by city type. Please see the final graph below that plots the total fares per month by city type.

#### Below is a chart that shows the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average far per ride and the average fare per driver broken down by city type; rural, suburban and urban.

##### First looking at the total rides, we can see that rural has the least amount of rides given with only 125 total rides. Suburban has 5 times as many rides given with 625 total rides and then urban has 1,625 total rides clearly being the highest amount of rides given. When looking at this information, it isn't too far off what I would have imagined when starting this analysis. Rural areas don't tend to have as much of a need for ride services as there is a lower population and they tend to have thier own modes of transportations because there is a higher need to travel for basic necessities unlike in a large city where you have most everything you need close by. 

##### Next looking at the total drivers, there are very few drivers in rural areas, 78, and about 30 times the amount in urban areas, 2,405, with suburban falling inbetween that with 490 drivers. With rural areas having less rides and what I can imagine being less of a demand for ride services there would be less of a need for drivers in rural communities. It would also be harder for rural city drivers to have a consistent income from ride services if there were too many in the area as there are not as many riders. In a large city setting and urban area there is much more of a demand for drivers as there are many more people looking for rides, these rides are also probably shorter distances and easier for drivers to have multiple rides within a short period of time, the market is also more saturated with drivers which could make it a bit harder to have consistent ride to give as there is more competition. 

##### When we look at the average fare per ride we see that the rural area fares are higher than the other city types with an average of $34.62 per ride and urban having the lowest at $24.53 per ride and again, suburban falling in the middle with $30.97 per ride. I can pull a couple conclusions from this information, one being that rural areas may have the longest rides because it is typically a more spread out area with a need for rides being longer than those in suburban and urban cites which leads to higher fares. There are also less drivers in rural areas which can spike the cost of rides as well. Urban areas I assume for the most part are smaller distances in city centers which leads to smaller fares but they can be elevated due to higher demand with larger populations driving a surge price. 

##### Finally, looking at the average fare per driver, we see that rural area drivers have the highest average with $55.49, suburban falling in the middle again at $39.50, and urban areas at the low end at $16.57. This shows that the rural area drivers are having the highest return per ride verses the other city types. A couple factors probably play into this with there being fewer drivers and longer rides. The concern would be that the urban areas are so low with the driver fare not even bieng $17 on average. 

### Below are a few business strategies that address some concerns that were noticed after running our analysis. 

#### * The first suggestion would be to attempt to limit the amount of drivers in the the urban areas, while it may be to the companies benefit to have so many in terms of always having a driver for guests ride needs it does affect the amount of money that drivers are able to make. When someone is not able to make enough money at thier job it can lead to poor performance or them leaving the job completely. I think it is in the company's interest to make sure they retain the drivers they have and make sure they are performing to the standards that PyBer would like to uphold and it is easier to enforce standards and rule when you have quality employees working for you and they are making a fair living. 
#### * A second suggestion would be to try to promote more rides in suburban areas, this was one city type that jsut kind of fell in the middle in each category we looked at. While that is not a problem really I think there is room for growth in total fares if there is a push to get a few more rides for people in these areas. There seems to be plenty of drivers in the area to support the current amount of rides needed and support more rides if there was the demand for it. PyBer could attempt to incentivize riders with a few discount codes to have them choose a ride service over other transportation methods or soemthing that I have seen before is an invite discount that current riders can send to thier friends and family to start them on using PyBer over any other transportation service or method. 
#### * A final suggestion would be to try to gain more drivers in rural areas, this would lead to a bit less in wages for the current drivers but there may be a bit of a shortage for the current amount of rides needed. With rides being longer drivers are not able to complete as many rides in a period of time like those that are in city centers. This leads to guests using PyBer to have to wait longer or not being able to use the service as frequently as needed. Having a few more drivers in rural areas I believe would lead to happier customers for PyBer.
